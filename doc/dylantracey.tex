I programmed the ARM11 emulator with the help of Freddie.

In our meetings we concluded that due to Freddies experience at programming, he would focus on the pipeline, and two of the instructions and I should contribute the other two instructions (multiply and single data transfer).

As we came to complete the first two sections the project, I decided to code the extension myself. The group helped me to set up the hardware of the raspberry pi and explained how to ouput to LEDs. After this setup advice, I then coded the extension.

This project has taught me a lot about working in a team and how to program. The group meetings and the collaborative nature helped me understand how to explain my code and also solidified the reasoning behind using good, clear and commented code. Also, the project gave me an overall understanding of the makings behind a computer especially when coding the extension. Furthermore, I realised the power of having just a few assembler instructions and how many possibilities this enabled.
