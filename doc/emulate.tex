The first part of the project regarded the emulate binary. It's purpose is to emulate an ARM11 execution of ARM11 assembled code from a binary file.

Firstly, we found it important to check to see that the required program arguments were given. Therefore, in our emulate.c we implemented the following for error checking:

\begin{verbatim}
  /*  Check a given filename exists, and return if not */
  FILE *file;
  if ((file = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL) {
    perror("Error opening file!");
    printf("Does the file %s exist?\nEXITING\n", argv[1]);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
\end{verbatim}

Secondly, once a file had been successfully found and opened, we initialised a new machine and the pipeline within that machine before loading the file we'd just opened into the machine memory.

\begin{verbatim}
  /*  Create and initialise a machine and a pipeline */
  machine_t machine;
  init_machine(&machine);
  init_pipeline(machine.pipeline);
  loadfile(file, &machine);
\end{verbatim}

Thirdly, we need to actually run the pipeline. So therefore we ran the below code (implementation to follow) before closing the pipeline, printing the machine, and finally closing the machine.

\begin{verbatim}
  /*  Execute the pipeline model of the ARM architecture */
  run_pipeline(&machine);
  close_pipeline(machine.pipeline);

  /*  Print the final state of the machine */
  print_machine(&machine);

  /*  Frees the machine by closing it */
  close_machine(&machine);
\end{verbatim}
