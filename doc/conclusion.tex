For the whole group this project has been very enjoyable and a good learning experience. We've all had experience of learning C, ARM11, and implementing our knowledge as a team into a sizeable project that has been successful.

We believe we've all learnt how structured you have to be in a team to achieve and to get things done. Also, it is of mention that we've all felt that we should communicate more when working in a team and that we should monitor the progress of individual members more in order to optimise the progress of the group as a whole.
