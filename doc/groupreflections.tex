All in all, the group was, for the most part, well organised and worked effectively together in accomplishing the various objectives and results in the project.

In terms of communication, the group was proficient at relaying the relevant information; both online, and during the numerous meetings, we all competently contributed our ideas and knowledge to the whole group.
