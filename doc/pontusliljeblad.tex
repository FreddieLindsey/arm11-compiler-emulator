My main part of the project was creating the assembler together with Adam. I also worked on the GPIO together with Adam and Dylan. I did mainly the multiply instructions for the assembler and the loop for the blinking light in the GPIO as well as some other minor things.

Normally, I would consider my strengths to be that I am communicative, innovative and a decently strong programmer. However, I feel like IÂ’ve underperformed greatly this project, mainly in the amount of work done by the other members compared to myself. Something that I could have done a lot better would have been to regularly go into the labs rather than trying to get work done from home. I do believe that the group in general did a good job, even though it was mainly carried by two members. Something that we do have to work a bit on the next time is to work more as one group rather than two small teams, since we had points in time where we were at completely different stages of the project.
