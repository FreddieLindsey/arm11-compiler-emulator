I did the emulate section with Dylan. After splitting the work into separate folders and files, I completed the pipeline and execution as a whole of the emulation as well as half of the instructions. Being the group leader and a experienced programmer, I helped Dylan complete one of his instructions and spearheaded the group approach to the entirety of the work.
