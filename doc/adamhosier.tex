I was mainly involved in creating the assembler part with Pontus. I built the main structure for the assembler, including file I/O, data-structures to handle the different instruction types, and some of the instruction specific functions to translate them to binary. I consider myself a comparatively fluent programmer in the group, so I was able to help and guide other members in completing their own sections.
