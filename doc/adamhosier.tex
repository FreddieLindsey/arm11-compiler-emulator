I was mainly involved in creating the assembler part with Pontus. I built the main structure for the assembler, including file I/O, data-structures to handle the different instruction types, and some of the instruction specific functions to translate them to binary.

I consider myself a comparatively fluent programmer in the group, so I was able to help and guide other members in completing their own sections. I have learned that in the future, more time should be spent planning the project before starting programming. This includes establishing guidelines for programming conventions, as well as the overall layout of the programs, knowing where code can be shared and planning ahead to make sure as little code as possible needs to be rewritten.
