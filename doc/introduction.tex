The members of the group for this project were: Adam Hosier, Pontus Liljeblad, Freddie Lindsey and Dylan Tracey. For the majority of the project, the groups chosen way of working was remotely and our communication was done over the internet. But to ensure a clear direction and understanding of how to tackle problems with the project, we held regular meeting at least few times a week. The main focuses during those meetings were to figure out how the work would be partitioned between our various members and also how the overlying file structure should be organised to best divide the work into manageable and understandable sections to complete.

After the implementation of the first three parts we then decided on the groups extension. We chose to implement a countdown sequence on LEDs connected to the Raspberry Pi similar to those used to signal the start of professional motor races (Formula 1, NASCAR).
