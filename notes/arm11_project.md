# ARM11 Project

## Part I - Emulator

- Read an ARM binary file of object code
	- Object code consists of 32-bit 'words' that should be loaded into a C data structure
- Instructions
	- All instructions are 32-bits (4 bytes)
	- ARM memory is byte addressable, but the instructions are aligned on a 4-byte boundary, ensuring all instructions are in addresses that are multiples of 4.
	- Instructions may modify ARM memory and general purpose registers
	- A [branch instruction](http://www.johnloomis.org/NiosII/isa/isa4.html) may change the PC to a target address.
- Intialisation
	- All registers and memory locations should be initialised to 0.
- Running the program
	- Binary file loads
	- Initialise the processor/memory
	- Execute instructions as per architecture.
- ARM system
	- Registers
		- 17 32-bit registers (4-bit Reg Code - 17 not accessible)
		- Reg 0 - 12 are general purpose
		- Reg 13 - 14 are called SP, RP respectively and can be ignored for this exercise
		- Reg 15 is the PC register
		- Reg 16 is the CPSR register
			- Configures operating mode for ARM processor and checks conditionals
			- We are only concerned with it's top 4-bits. 
	
	| Flag bit | Flag | Semantic |
	| :-- | :-- | --- |
	| 31 | N | last result was negative |
	| 30 | Z | last result was zero |
	| 29 | C | carry bit |
	| 28 | V | overflow bit |
	
	- Instruction set
		- No `halt` instruction in ARM instruction set --> the processor will run forever
		- We will use an instruction `all-0` as a psuedo-halt instruction (corresponds to `andeq r0, r0, r0`)
		- Upon terminating, we will print the following
			- The value of each register
			- The contents of any non-zero memory location

### Functions of an emulator class

#### Program functions

- Execute the three-phase pipeline
- Set pipeline stages during branch: 

		if [[Â decoded (starts with b) ]]; then 
			PC += offset 	; offset is calculated from the position 
							; of the instruction relative to PC + 8
			fetched = null 
		fi

- Check conditions in the instruction with the CPSR register

		if [[ condition_met || al ]]; then
			run instruction
		else
			pass
		fi

| Code | Suffix | CPSR flags | Interpretation |
| --- | --: | :-- | :-- |
| 0000 | eq | Z set | equal |
| 0001 | ne | Z clear | not equal |
| 1010 | ge | N equals V | greater or equal |
| 1011 | lt | N not equals to V | less than |
| 1100 | gt | Z clear AND (N equals V) | greater than |
| 1101 | le | Z set OR (N not equal to V) | less than or equal |
| 1110 | al | (ignored) | - |

#### Data processing instructions

Form

| | Bit from | Bit to | Semantic |
| :-- | --- | --- | :-- |
| *Cond* | 28 | 31 | Condition field |
| *Immediate Operand* | 25 | 25 | If set, *Operand2* is an immediate constant, otherwise it is a shifted register |
| *OpCode* | 21 | 24 | Minimal set of supported *OpCodes* details below. |
| *Set conditions* | 20 | 20 | If set, instruction should update CPSR flags |
| \\( R_{n} \\) | 16 | 19 | First operand is content of register \\( R_{n} \\) |
| \\( R_{d} \\) | 12 | 15 | Register to write result to \\( R_{d} \\) |
| *Operand2* | 0 | 11 | Either a rotated 8 bit *Immediate constant* or a shifted register (\\( R_{m} \\)). <br> Details on interpretation below. |

OpCodes

| OpCode | Mnemonic | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | :-- |
| 0000 | and | \\( R_{n} \\) AND *Operand2* |
| 0001 | eor | \\( R_{n} \\) EOR *Operand2* |
| 0010 | sub | \\( R_{n} \\) - *Operand2* |
| 0011 | rsb |  *Operand2* - \\( R_{n} \\) |
| 0100 | add | \\( R_{n} \\) + *Operand2* |
| 1000 | tst | as `and` but result not written |
| 1001 | teq | as `eor` but result not written |
| 1010 | cmp | as `sub` but result not written |
| 1100 | orr | \\( R_{n} \\) OR *Operand2* |
| 1101 | mov | *Operand2* |

*Operand2*

	Immediate constant

If *Operand2* is an immediate constant (I = 1), then bits 0 --> 7 are an unsigned 8-bit immediate value, and bits 8 --> 11 are the rotation.

Such that, the constants value is the 8-bit value, extended to 32-bit <br>(00000001 -> 00000001000000000000000000000000), <br> which is then rotated right an even number of positions as specified by the rotation bits (0, 2, 4, . . , 30)

Therefore, 

010100100110 <br> --> <br> 00000000000010011000000000000000

Note that is it not possible to load a 32-bit immediate value into a register; this must be done using load from memory.
